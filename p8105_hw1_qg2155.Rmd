## Question #1

Creating the dataframe 
```{r question_1}
library(tidyverse)

question_1 = tibble(
  vec_random = runif(10, 0, 5),
  vec_logical = vec_random > 2,
  vec_char = c("This", "is", "my", "answer", "to", "homework", "one", "question", "number", "one"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("yes", "no", "yes", "no", "yes", "no", "yes", "no", "yes", "no"))
)

question_1

## Taking the average of each variable
mean(question_1$vec_random)
mean(question_1$vec_logical)
mean(question_1$vec_char)
mean(question_1$vec_factor)
```
When trying to take the average of each variable, the output for variable vec_random is 2.760793 and vec_logical is 0.5. The results for vec_char and vec_factor are both NA. The error message for the character and factor vectors are that argument is not numeric or logical.
